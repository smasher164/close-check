# close-check

The repository contains the materials from my GopherCon 2021 talk [Writing a Static Analyzer for Go Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFa_zSrxDK8).
Inside the closecheck directory is the source to an `*analysis.Analyzer`, whose driver command is in main.go
rules.go contains a ruleguard pattern for detecting double closes.
